The project focuses on a robust ZTNA architecture to enforce strict identity verification, device compliance, and secure access controls.The project integrates advanced features such as <span style="color: red;">role-based access control (RBAC), DNS over HTTPS (DoH)</span> for secure outbound traffic and <span style="color: red;">web filtering policies</span>. This implementation enhances the overall network security posture and also demonstrates the effectiveness of Zero Trust strategies in mitigating insider threats, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration risks.
