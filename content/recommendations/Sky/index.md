"I had the privilege of working with Aashvi for two years at Aryaka Networks, where I also had the opportunity to mentor her. She excelled as a Cloud and Network Security Engineer. Aashvi demonstrated exceptional technical skills, configuring physical, virtual, and cloud firewalls (Checkpoint, Palo Alto), as well as Private Access NCP VPN, to deliver secure network designs with features like threat hunting, intrusion detection, SSL inspection, Deep Packet Inspection and DNS security. She also deployed cloud-based security solutions, managed firewalls, and zero-trust network access.

She worked with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and SOC analysis to correlate security events and automate responses, optimizing threat detection and response times.

Aashvi’s curiosity, fast learning, and innovative ideas consistently improved efficiency, earning her recognition from both clients and colleagues.With her strong technical background and ongoing master’s degree in cybersecurity, Aashvi is exceptionally well-prepared for any cybersecurity role. I highly recommend her as a dedicated and skilled professional."
