  â€œI had the pleasure of working with Aashvi during her tenure at Aryaka Networks, where she
demonstrated exceptional promise and dedication in the field of network security. As a fresh
graduate, Aashvi brought a remarkable level of enthusiasm and a quick grasp of complex concepts,
which was evident in her work with Palo Alto and Check Point Firewalls. During her tenure in Aryaka,
Aashvi quickly became proficient in configuring, managing, and optimizing these systems, even
though she was relatively new to the tools. Her capacity to learn and adapt was nothing short of
remarkable, empowering her to contribute to the team right away. Beyond technical expertise,
Aashvi displayed strong problem-solving skills, an eagerness to learn, and a collaborative spirit.I
am confident that Aashvi will excel in her career and continue to make significant contributions in
the network and security domain."
