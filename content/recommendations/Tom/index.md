  “I had the pleasure of working closely with Aashvi Nagendra during the summer of 2024 within our
embedded security team at Alcon. During this time, there were multiple product security related
projects that Aashvi consistently demonstrated exceptional technical skills. One of these projects
was related to implementing unique security controls capabilities for a surgical medical device.
This project required in-depth knowledge of cloud integration, key management, automation and
hardening techniques. Aashvi developed a solution that served as a proof of concept that can
easily be extended into production. Beyond Aashvi’s technical abilities, Aashvi was able to explain
complex concepts to stakeholders which was a key asset for my team. I highly recommend Aashvi
Nagendra for any role required to think outside of the box in creating product security solutions and
exceptional teamwork."
