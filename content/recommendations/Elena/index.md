  “I had the pleasure of meeting Aashvi through the AnitaB Grace Hopper mentoring initiative, and I
was impressed by her strong foundation in cybersecurity. She has a great understanding of the field
and combines it with a curiosity to keep learning and growing.
Aashvi is very passionate, collaborative, and brings great energy to every challenge. Her mindset
makes her valuable to any team. I’m excited to see the impact she’ll continue to make in the tech
